      <h1>Abstract</h1>
      <p class="note"> The paper focuses on a syntactic and statistical analysis to extract bilingual collocations from
        a parallel corpus. It describes how to obtain preferred syntactic patterns from collocational expressions in
        German and English using <i>AntConc</i> in order to extract word co-occurrences. Collocational knowledge is
        profoundly important for developing language skills, and successfully translating across languages. The aim of
        this paper is to analyse to what extent <i>AntConc</i> can be beneficial in extracting and compiling
        collocational expressions from parallel German-English
        corpora of Kafka&apos;s novels <i>The Trail</i> and <i>Metamorphosis</i>.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>In the past two decades corpora of language data have started to play an increasingly significant role in
        determining how languages are taught, perceived and used. Corpora have been applied in a wide range of areas,
        such as translation studies, grammar and dictionary development and language acquisition approaches.
        Translators, linguists and terminologists thrive in a cutting-edge working environment, where mastering good
        computer literacy skills and being well-versed in strategic information mining is essen-tial for both being able
        to use the resources at their disposal and to find required andsignificant information in a short period of
        time. This involves, for instance, finding translation equivalents and domain-specific terms, extracting
        collocations, idioms, and phrasalverbs, and exploring the terms used in specific contexts in order to render
        future docu-ments grammatically, semantically and stylistically appropriate for the target audience. In order to
        conduct such a cross-linguistic analysis of corpora, software tools are required to process them and display the
        results in a comprehensible way. For this analysis we will be using the corpus analysis program <i>AntConc</i>.
      </p>

      <p>The paper focuses on the analysis of small sized corpora with the language combination English-German
        containing Kafka&apos;s novels <i>The Trail</i> and <i>Metamorphosis</i>. This contribution aims at
        investigating, from a
        comparative corpus-assisted perspective, what are the salient features the textual analysis software provides
        that can be beneficial to translators, linguists, terminologists, and language learners when translating literary
        texts and learning a new language. Indeed, collocations are recurrent combinations of words that co-occur in a
        specific context, and are notoriously difficult to translate literally into another language because they
        are opaque. I analyse the software&apos;s limitations, depict the advantages and disadvantages, and conclude with a discussion on its future development.</p>

      <h1>What is <i>AntConc</i>?</a></h1>
      <p>AntConc</i> is a freeware concordance program for Windows, Macintosh OS X, and Lunix. The analysis type
        preformed is based on data mining methods and algorithms. The data import supports HTML, TXT and XML format.
        <i>AntConc</i> hosts a comprehensive set of functions including a powerful concordance, word and keyword
        frequency generators,
        tools for cluster and lexical bundle analysis, and a word distribution plot. Its vocabulary
        search function can be divided into basic search and advanced search. It runs on both
        Windows and Linux/Unix based system and includes an easy-to-use, intuitive graphical
        user interface and offers a powerful concordancer, word and keyword frequency generators,
        tools for cluster and lexical bundle analysis, and a word distribution plot.
      </p>


      <h1>General context and purpose of the analysis</h1>
      <p> The developer of <i>AntConc</i> Laurence Anthony states in his linguistic research <i>A critical
          look at software tools in corpus linguistics</i> that "the functionality offered by software tools
        largely dictates what corpus linguistic research methods are available to a researcher, and
        hence, the design of tools will become an increasingly important factor as corpora become
        larger and the statistical analysis of linguistic data becomes increasingly complex".
        The analysis depends on quantitative and qualitative analytical techniques to interpret
        the findings. The success of corpus linguistics is intrinsically related to the tools used to
        access, analyse, and display the results of corpus searches. Recent rapid advances in the
        development of computer technology, particularly the availability of storage of linguistic
        databases, is leading to a new approach in both the field of translation studies and language teaching and
        learning. In fact, several examples of specific word combinations
        or phrases are stored electronically in corpora which allow learners and researchers to
        discover and analyse cross-linguistic patterns by observing extensive naturally occurring
        phrases.</p>

      <h1>Methodology &amp; Analysis</a></h1>
      <p> The main focus of the paper lies in extracting collocational expressions from German
        and English texts by analysing preferred syntactic patters obtained from the parallel
        corpora chosen. The approach lies in filtering the collocations based on both linguistic
        and statistical constraints. The bilingual collocations have lexical correlations between
        them and are rigid in both languages.  It is important
        to highlight that only the following functions and tools, which are intrinsic to the research question,
        have been analysed and evaluated:

        <li><a>Clusters/N-Grams Tool</a></li>
        <li><a>Collocates Tool</a></li>
        <li><a>Additional features</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h1> Suggestions for development for corpora analyses</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p><i>AntConc</i> preforms all operations directly on the raw corpus with data solely encoded
          in HTML, TXT, or XML format. This is a major weakness of the software as more
          formats need to be supported, such as TMX in order to be able to import the results
          into translation memory tools . For instance, it could be developed a function where the
          user could fully align the results obtained from one corpus to another corpus in order
          to create a bilingual term extraction. Like this the user could apply the cloned files
          directly into a machine translation system that uses a transfer approach as it relies on
          correspondence between segments in the source and target language. Although <i>AntConc</i>
          offers an easy way to save and copy and paste results into a spreadsheet program for
          further analysis using simply keyword shortcuts, yet there is no function to import and
          work on two corpora simultaneously in different languages. The software does not have
          efficient features when working on bilingual corpora because correspondences between
          collocations in two languages are largely unexplored. The software is designed to analyse
          only one corpus at the time. The ability to compile a set of translated collocational
          expressions automatically would increase the portability of machine-translation systems
          and both facilitate and accelerate the development of a dictionary. I propose a bilingual
          collocation concordancer - a tool that provides the user with collocation correspondences
          between two languages. Therefore, more sophisticated methods need to be implemented
          in order to be able to develop an collocation dictionary by using <i>AntConc</i>. On a personal
          note, it is apparent that nowadays cross-linguistic corpus-assisted discourse studies are
          still a niche, especially those focusing on translation studies. Thus, I want to expand this
          promising field of research by contributing with the present analysis. As several researchers suggest, corpus
          linguists should embrace acquiring
          skills in computer science in order to be able to develop analytical tools. In doing so,
          translators and linguists will develop their own tools in order to tailor the output to their
          own research needs and take control of their own research agenda. It would provide
          them with more flexibility to develop tools for a particular task and gives them an insight
          into the issues the developers need to tackle when developing the tool. The suggestions
          advocated in this paper have been derived from an empirical validation.</p>
