 # Abstract
The present paper focuses on a syntactic and statistical analysis to extract bilingual collocations from a parallel corpus. It describes how to obtain preferred syntactic patterns from collocational expressions in German and English using AntConc in order to extract word co-occurrences. Collocational knowledge is profoundly important for developing language skills, and successfully translating across languages.The aim of this paper is to analyse to what extent AntConc can be beneficial in extracting and compiling collocational expressions from parallel German-English corpora of Kafka’s novels <em>The Trail</em> and <em>Metamorphosis</em>.
  
 # Research question:
<em>To what extand can AntConc be used for extracting and compiling bilingual collocational expressions for the development of a bilingual collocation dictionary with the language combination German and English by analysing corpora containing Kafka’s novels The Trail and Metamorphosis</em>?
