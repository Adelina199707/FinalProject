 # Abstract
The present paper focuses on a syntactic and statistical analysis to extract bilin-gual collocations from a parallel corpus. It describes how to obtain preferred syntac-tic patterns from collocational expressions in German and English usingAntConcin order to extract word co-occurrences. Collocational knowledge is profoundly im-portant for developing language skills, and successfully translating across languages.The aim of this paper is to analyse to what extend AntConc can be beneficialin extracting and compiling collocational expressions from parallel German-Englishcorpora of Kafka’s novels <em>The Trail<em> and <em>Metamorphosis<em>.
  
 # Reserach question:
To what extand can AntConc be used for extracting andcompiling bilingual collocational expressions for the development of a bilingualcollocation dictionary with the language combination German and English by analysing corpora containing Kafka’s novels <em>The Trail<em> and <em>Metamorphosis<em>?
